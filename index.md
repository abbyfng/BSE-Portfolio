# MIDI Controller
I made a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) Controller that can be used to send MIDI data to my computer.  My computer can then interpret the signal and use it to add a sound or play a virtual instrument on my computer (without needing to have the actual instrument).

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was figuring out how to wire the potentiometers (a button and a knob) to connect to my Arudino board, because going into this project, I felt that wiring seemed the most intimidating and I wanted to figure that out first.  I used a red wire in the positive column on the side of the breadboard to connect to the 5V pin on my Arduino, and a blue wire in the negative column to connect to the GND pin.  Then, I connected the knob and button, each to one LED and to the two columns on the side so they'd form a circuit with my Arduino board.  I also paired each LED with a resistor so they wouldn't burn out.  When I was connecting the button to the LED, I accidentally formed a circle between the LED and the button, cutting out the Arduino, so the LED didn't light up properly.  I fixed this by moving the longer leg of the LED so that it was connected to the ground wire of the button and that the button's other wire connected to the column on the side.  This way, it formed a circuit with the Arduino, and when the button was pressed down, it completed the circuit, allowing the LED to light up.
